Issues with current design

-The implemented elevator panel is uneven when distributing elevator button
  
-The large Key holes add un-neccesary visual clutter to the panel 
  The issue adds clutter and may lead to problems with visibility when attempting to interact with the panel.
  
-The ground floor does not follow the logic of the panel
  The ground floor is designated with a G while the preceeding floors are designated by numbers. This destroys any consistancy and adds
  unwanted confusion to users by using letters.
-The Ground floor button is misplaced creating an unsatisfying Asthetic by adding visual noise.

Elevator and feedback
Elevators provide feedback through the use of lights, buttons and signals.
The current design is visually unappealing and over cluttered from a design standpoint.
When developing an interface the issues faced from simplifying controls is oversimplification to the point where the user 
can no longer understand the panels original purpose.
