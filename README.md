Issues with current design

-The implemented elevator panel is uneven when distributing elevator button
  
-The large Key holes add un-neccesary clutter to the panel 
  possibly leading to confusion when users are attempting to operate the elevator.
  
-The ground floor could be confusing as it has no number like the other floors 
  this could confuse users as they see number designation for the floors 2-4 except ground floor
  
Common uses for an elevator
-accesing other floors

Elevator and feedback
Elevators provide feedback through the use of lights, buttons and signals.
The current design is visually unappealing and over cluttered from a design standpoint.
When developing an interface the issues faced from simplifying controls is oversimplification to the point where the user 
can no longer understand the panels original purpose.
